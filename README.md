# Chatbot

The Ace chatbot is an application of machine learning techniques that provides a conversational interface for students to interact with for common advising questions. Ace is built on a neural network developed using TensorFlow.

The chatbot is trained on 'patterns' for a particular question, matched to a tag, using natural language processing techniques such as tokenization and NER. These techniques help the chatbot to understand and respond appropriately to user messages.

Tokenization involves breaking down user messages into smaller units such as words or phrases, which allows the chatbot to more accurately understand the meaning behind user input.

The deep neural network powering the chatbot is trained on a large dataset of sample conversations, which allows it to recognize patterns in user input and generate appropriate responses with a high degree of accuracy. The chatbot can also be fine-tuned and customized for specific industries or use cases.

Overall, the TensorFlow AI chatbot project represents a powerful tool for businesses and organizations looking to improve customer engagement and automate customer support. By leveraging the power of machine learning, sentiment analysis, and tokenization, the chatbot provides a seamless and personalized conversational experience for users.
